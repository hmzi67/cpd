- ✅ When specific exercise selected, only that exercise shows detailed feedback
- ✅ "All Exercises" mode shows overview + active exercises only
- ✅ No more interference from other exercises

#### 2. Updated Dropdown Options

- ✅ **NEW**: Exact dropdown options as requested:
  - All Exercises
  - Cervical Flexion (Chin-to-chest)
  - Cervical Extension (Look upward)
  - Lateral Neck Tilt (Left and Right)
  - Neck Rotation (Turn head left/right)
  - Chin Tuck (Retract chin)

#### 3. Enhanced Focused Feedback

- ✅ Large status indicators for selected exercise
- ✅ Detailed instructions and tips
- ✅ Clear congratulatory messages when detected
- ✅ Better calibration progress display
- ✅ Exercise-specific guidance

### 🎯 How Conditional Feedback Works

1. **Select "All Exercises"**: Shows overview grid + active exercises
2. **Select specific exercise**: Shows ONLY that exercise with detailed feedback
3. **No interference**: Other exercises don't show feedback when focused
4. **Clear focus**: Large status indicators and instructions for selected exercise
